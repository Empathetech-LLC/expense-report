# Usage

Currently, Empathetech LLC uses QuickBooks. The script is run on the output from Expenses > All transactions > Year to Date > Export. We don't make those public for obvious reasons.

Once the reports are finished exporting, they are converted to .csv. Those .csv are then provided to the script like so...

```bash
python3 expense-report.py
```

# Contributing

If you think it's cool that we publish our financial, why not be a part of it?!
