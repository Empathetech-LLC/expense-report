# Expense report

Empathetech LLC's expense data, made public.

# Usage

Currently, Empathetech uses QuickBooks (not affiliated). 

`expense-report.py` generates the reports by running

```bash
python3 expense-report.py PATH_TO_QB_CSV
```

on the output from... QuickBooks > Expenses > All transactions > Year to Date > Export.

## Re-usage

The goal is to update the report monthly. The [latest](./latest.csv) report is tracked as well as [previous](./archive/) reports.
